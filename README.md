 Employee app using public API requests

 In this project I created an employee app using a fetch API. Each time the page is refreshed there is a new fetch request sent to the Random User Generator API. 12 employees are then displayed on the webpage. All of this is created dynamically with JavaScript functions. There is also a search input that is created dynamically and there is search functionality created with JS to search for an employee's name.

When an employee card is clicked it is displayed in a modal, containing additional information about that employee. The employee's birthday and telephone number are reformatted with JS functions. There is also funcionality to move between employees while being displayed in the modal, with "prev" and "next" buttons, and also with the left and right arrow buttons on your keyboard. This functionality is also created with JS. When the user searches for an employee, this modal functionality is also updated to move between the employees that are chosen in the search field. 

Although the html and css were provided in this project, I tweaked them both slightly to add some personal touches and make for a clean and tight presentation.
